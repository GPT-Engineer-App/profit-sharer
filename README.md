**Profit Sharing Mechanism:** When sellers utilize their WBTC/ETH to provide liquidity on Uniswap V3 through your platform, the profits generated from trading fees undergo a meticulous distribution process, ensuring fairness and transparency. Here's how it works:

- **80% to the buyer:** This significant portion of the trading fees is allocated directly to the buyer. This incentivizes buyers to actively participate in liquidity provision, acknowledging their crucial role in facilitating trades on the platform. Buyers are thus duly rewarded for their contribution to market liquidity, fostering a robust trading ecosystem.
    
- **20% to the company:** The remaining portion of the trading fees, 20%, is allocated to the company. This allocation supports the operational and developmental costs of the platform, including maintenance, security, and further enhancements. By reinvesting a portion of the profits into platform development, the company ensures sustainability and ongoing improvements, ultimately benefiting all users. This profit distribution model remains consistent whether the liquidity provision is solely by the seller or in collaboration with a buyer who chooses to participate, fostering a fair and equitable ecosystem for all users.
    

**Transaction Process:**

**Initiation of Transaction:** When a seller decides to start a transaction with a buyer, they must first deposit the necessary funds into the Uniswap pool we've discussed earlier. This step ensures that the liquidity required for the transaction is readily available.

**Execution of Transaction:** Once the funds are deposited into the Uniswap pool, the transaction can proceed. The seller then sends the agreed-upon amount of BTC to the buyer. This transfer is facilitated securely through the platform's infrastructure.

**Profit Distribution:** Following the completion of the transaction, the profits generated from trading fees are distributed as follows:

- **25% to the buyer:** A quarter of the profits is allocated to the buyer as a reward for their participation in the transaction and liquidity provision.
- **25% to the seller:** Another quarter of the profits is allocated to the seller, acknowledging their role in facilitating the transaction and providing liquidity.
- **50% to the company:** The remaining half of the profits is retained by the company to support platform operations and development efforts.

**Liquidity Provision by Sellers:**

**Flexible Liquidity Options:** Sellers are empowered to choose the duration of their liquidity provision, ranging from 5 minutes to 1 hour, aligning with their trading strategies and objectives. This flexibility enables sellers to optimize their liquidity provision and maximize their potential earnings from trading fees.

**BTC Transaction Rules for Buyers:**

**BTC Deposits and Investments:** Buyers are limited to depositing and transacting exclusively in BTC. This simplifies the transaction process and maintains consistency within the platform's ecosystem, mitigating potential complexities associated with multi-currency transactions.

**Smart Contract Integration for Transaction and Profit Management:**

**Escrow and Transaction Handling:** Solidity smart contracts manage the secure transfer of cryptocurrencies and the escrow process, ensuring the integrity and reliability of transactions. These contracts facilitate seamless trade execution and settlement, minimizing transactional friction and enhancing the overall user experience.

**Dynamic Profit Distribution:** Smart contracts also handle the dynamic distribution of profits from liquidity provisions, ensuring fairness and transparency in profit-sharing among stakeholders. Real-time profit calculations and transparent profit-sharing mechanisms enhance trust and confidence among platform users.

**Comprehensive BTC Management for Buyers:**

**Secure BTC Storage:** The platform offers secure wallet functionality for buyers to manage and safely store their BTC holdings. Robust security features, including multi-signature authentication and regular security audits, safeguard user funds against unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

**BTC Withdrawals:** Buyers can withdraw their BTC to external wallets or utilize them for transactions within the platform. Seamless withdrawal processes and secure transaction management interfaces ensure reliability and convenience for buyers.

**Seller Payment Method:**

**Stripe Integration:** Sellers can conveniently receive payments via Stripe, a trusted payment gateway. This integration facilitates seamless payment processing, allowing sellers to securely receive funds directly into their bank accounts or Stripe wallets, further enhancing user satisfaction and facilitating smooth transactions.

This platform is designed as a Windows application that connects people for trade, providing a user-friendly interface and robust features to facilitate secure and efficient cryptocurrency transactions.
